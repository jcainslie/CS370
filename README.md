1. Briefly explain the work that you did on this project: What code were you given? What code did you create yourself?

I was given code that extended the maze game so that it could be controled by the model generation. I was also given fully developed code that managed the game experince. I was also given a partial developed appliction to start the maze game. For my part I developed the loop that controlled the epoch and episodes that where used to generate the model and test the model. I was able to use skills learned in this class along with information that I learned form YouTube and Google to sucessfully complete this project.

1. Connect your learning from throughout this course to the larger field of computer science:
  a) What do computer scientists do and why does it matter?
      The biggest thing that a computer scientists does to understand the data they are given. If they don't under stand the data then they cannot effectively make that       data work or detech issues/biases with the data.

  b) How do I approach a problem as a computer scientist?
      Like I state before having a full understanding the data is a number one priority. Also having a understanding of story the end user is wanting the data to show         will help in creating a model that is accurate and meets the functional needs of the end user.

  c) What are my ethical responsibilities to the end user and the organization?
      My ehtical concerns would be fully understanding the data and the limits and/or biases that that data contains and how it effects the model and to relay that             information to the end user/organization. Also if my model does demostrate bias to fully understand where that bias is coming from and identify way to mitigate it       if needed.
